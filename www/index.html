The EDK II Fat Driver is separate from the EDK II project only because the terms of use of the code are unique, requiring us to keep it in a separate code repository (the terms are basically that code developed using the FAT32 Specification must be associated with EFI). The EDK II Fat Driver is structured as a Package that fits into the EDK II's overall build and packaging system.</p><p>This project is a <em>subproject</em> of the EDK II project, and is only used to house the FAT32 code repository. All development tools in the EDK project are integrated with this project, so come here only to update the Subversion repository or to get access to the latest code snapshots. Use the EDK project to post issues, join mailing lists, participate in discussion forums, etc. In short, consider them one project with two code repositories.</p><h3>Working with the FAT32 Code</h3><p>The FAT-Driver project is sponsored by Intel and released under the BSD License with one additional term.

It is a near complete rewrite of the original FAT-Driver with over 80% of the code being specific just to the Enhanced-FAT-Driver. The new driver is faster and takes up only 66% of the original FAT-Driver's memory footprint. </p><h4>What makes the Enhanced-FAT-Driver better?</h4><ul><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Better Architecture </p><ul><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">More modular design thanks to object oriented and hierarchical design </p></li></ul></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Logic directory approach used in place of the physical directory </p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Easier to maintain and debug </p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">80% of the code was completely rewritten to make it smaller and faster </p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Higher Performance </p><ul><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A cache mechanism to cache recently opened directories </p></li></ul></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A more efficient 8.3 name generation algorithm </p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">10x, 100x or even 1000x acceleration when creating thousands files/directories </p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Smaller Size</p><ul><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Simplified the controller name from &quot;FAT File System[FAT16] 200MB&quot; to &quot;FAT File System&quot; </p></li></ul></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Succinct coding style </p></li><li><p>2/3 the image size of the original FAT-Driver </p></li></ul><h4>Joining the FAT-Driver Project </h4><p>To join the FAT-Driver Project simply click on the &quot;Request Project Membership/Role&quot; link above and choose &quot;edk2.Participant&quot; as a requested role (that's the default role for all new project members). Upon receipt of your request, the FAT-Driver Maintainer will approve your project membership.
